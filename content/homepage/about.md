## About Me 
I'm a third year Ph.D. student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. Ananth Grama. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies in Electronic Information Engineering with a minor in Artificial intelligence at the [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

#### Research interests
* My research focuses on LLM post-training, particularly on synthetic data generation, reward modeling and self-improvement.
