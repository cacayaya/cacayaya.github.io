      <description>LLMs Can Get “Brain Rot” Recently, we published a paper examining what happens when large language models consume too much highly popular but low quality content such as viral tweets and short social posts. The results were striking: reasoning ability fell by 23 percent, long-context memory decreased by 30 percent, and simulated personality tests showed spikes in narcissism and psychopathy. Even after retraining on clean, high-quality data, the model struggled to fully recover.&#xA;We call this phenomenon “LLM Brain Rot”, as it closely resembles what can happen to the human mind when it is continuously exposed to shallow, repetitive, and emotionally charged information.</description>

      <description>The Role of Human “Freedom” and “Individuality” in the Evolution of Intelligence From Escape from Freedom&#xA;From an evolutionary perspective, the history of humankind can be seen as a process of deepening individuation and freedom. Humanity’s departure from the pre-human stage marked the first step away from the compulsion of instinct, marking the beginning of our quest for freedom.&#xA;If instinct represents a special behavioral pattern determined by our neural structure, we can observe a clear trend across the animal kingdom: the lower an animal’s level of development, the more perfectly it adapts to nature, and the more rigidly its behavior is governed by instinct and reflex.</description>
